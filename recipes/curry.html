    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Curry that's faster to make than it is to get delivered? We're in. We've done green, red, yellow, and Massaman curries, but we were missing another Thai classic: panang curry! Never had it? It's like red curry's richer, milder, peanutty cousin, and it's <strong>SO</strong> good!</p>

    <p>This is our inspired, veggie-packed version made with easier-to-find ingredients and your choice of chicken or tofu for protein. It's SO <strong>rich</strong> and <strong>comforting</strong>, you won't believe it only takes <strong>30 minutes</strong>. Let us show you how it's done!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <h3>Protein</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>14 oz extra-firm tofu, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Curry</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2-3 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil</li>
          <li>1/2 large yellow onion, minced</li>
          <li>4 large cloves garlic, pressed or finely minced</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp ginger, grated or finely minced</li>
          <li>1/2 cup panang curry paste</li>
          <li>2 14oz cans light coconut milk </li>
          <li>1/2 - 3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
          <li>1-2 Tbsp peanut butter (optional)</li>
          <li>1-2 Tbsp maple syrup (optional)</li>
          <li>1 small red bell pepper, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
          <li>2 cups cauliflower florets</li>
          <li>2-3 cups baby spinach
        </ul>

      <h3>For Serving</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rice or quinoa</li>
          <li>Lime wedges</li>
          <li>Fresh cilantro</li>
          <li>Roasted salted peanuts, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>GRAINS: If you are serving your curry with rice or quinoa, start it at this time.</li>
          <li>CURRY: Heat a large rimmed skillet or pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil and onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for 1 minute more.</li>
          <li>Add curry paste (store-bought curry paste is more concentrated, so be sure to start with less!) and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and slightly bubbly. Add the coconut milk and sea salt (omit/reduce if using store-bought curry paste) and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust at this time, adding peanut butter for richness, maple syrup for sweetness, or more salt for balance.</li>
          <li>After adjusting for flavor balance, add the bell pepper, cauliflower, and chicken (if using) and bring to a light simmer. Cover and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the cauliflower is tender.</li>
          <li>TOFU: While the curry simmers, heat a medium-sized nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add ~1 ½ Tbsp avocado oil (enough to fully cover the bottom of the skillet) and then add the cubed tofu. Fry until crispy and golden brown on all sides, ~2 minutes per side. Optionally, transfer to a paper towel-lined plate after frying to absorb excess oil. Once the veggies are tender, add the fried tofu to the curry.</li>
          <li>When the vegetables are tender and the (optional) protein is incorporated, add the baby spinach (optional) and stir. Once the spinach is wilted, the curry is ready to serve with your choice of grains.</li>
          <li>This curry is delicious with a squeeze of lime juice and garnished with cilantro and chopped peanuts.</li>
          <li>Leftovers keep for 4-5 days in the refrigerator or in the freezer for up to 1 month.</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>We prefer this recipe with our homemade Panang Curry Paste for best flavor, but it does work with store-bought with a few adjustments. Store-bought curry paste is much saltier and tastes less fresh. To compensate, we recommend doubling the ginger, omitting the salt, and adding peanut butter and maple syrup to taste.</li>
          <li>Prep/cook time does not include cooking optional proteins.</li>
          <li>Nutrition information is a rough estimate calculated with homemade panang curry paste, the lesser amounts of avocado oil and salt, and without optional ingredients such as grains, tofu, and chicken.</li>
        </ul>
