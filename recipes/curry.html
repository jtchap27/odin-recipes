    <p>Curry that's faster to make than it is to get delivered? We're in. We've done green, red, yellow, and Massaman curries, but we were missing another Thai classic: panang curry! Never had it? It's like red curry's richer, milder, peanutty cousin, and it's <strong>SO</strong> good!</p>

    <p>This is our inspired, veggie-packed version made with easier-to-find ingredients and your choice of chicken or tofu for protein. It's SO <strong>rich</strong> and <strong>comforting</strong>, you won't believe it only takes <strong>30 minutes</strong>. Let us show you how it's done!</p>
